This program does not collect and use your personal information. This program runs in a Windows Sandbox and does not request any additional permissions other than Microsoft Store telemetry.

Telemetry monitors app crashes. The developer can't know the specific crash for each user, but can see the total number of crashes for all users who have used it.
